  <h3>
    About the 4675kHz frequency:
  </h3>
Some radio amateurs may stumble upon a pirate radio station on the frequency 4675 kHz. She was probably known on 4695 kHz and called herself "TsVYeF". I honestly don't know if this is the same station only on 4675kHz since it no longer broadcast on that frequency.
  <br><br>
  I saw the first appearance at the end of July or August, which broadcast on 4695 kHz. I even recorded streams on this frequency, but my channel was blocked due to alleged community violations
  <br><br>
  <b>So what is your daily broadcast on 4675 kHz?</b><br> I donâ€™t know any information about this station yet, but the creator himself contacted Zokalal and threatened that if he told everything about his radio station, he would feel bad.
  <br><br><b>What is she doing?</b><br>Common actions that an ordinary radio hooligan does: turns on music, makes a marker at uvb76, the pip, low pip, etc.<br>
